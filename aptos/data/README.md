# Data Directory Structure

This directory contains all persistent data for the Aptos indexer services.

## Directory Layout

```
data/
├── fullnode/         # Aptos full node blockchain data (500GB+ for mainnet)
├── postgres/         # PostgreSQL database data (indexed blockchain data)
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Storage Requirements

- **fullnode/**: ~500GB+ for mainnet, grows over time
- **postgres/**: ~50-200GB depending on processors and data retention

## Backup Considerations

- **fullnode/**: Can be regenerated by syncing from network (takes time)
- **postgres/**: Critical indexed data, should be backed up regularly

## Cleanup

To remove all data and start fresh:
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf data/*
```

All service data is now stored in this directory for easy management and backups.
