Stargately is on a mission to provide the best DAO community development tools that anyone can use to start building on Web3. [Blockroma](https://blockroma.com/) is our latest product that allows anyone to view wallet addresses, transaction hashes, and block information on EVM compatible blockchains with a single click.

Blockroma plays an important role in the armada of multiple tools that we are putting in the hands of blockchain developers. It is built with the modern web stack - TypeScript, KOA, React, Apollo GraphQL, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL.

Blockroma’s ultimate goal is to be a multi-chain browser, and the first step is being Ethereum web3 compatible.

## How Does Blockroma Work?

Part of the beauty of blockchain is that all transactions are stored on their respective chains in an open and transparent manner. Blockchain nodes store copies of all the information that is a part of these digital ledgers, but it is difficult to access this info unless you are running a node. Blockroma pulls information from blockchain nodes and combines it into an easily accessible search engine that anyone can view, explore, and query at any time.

blockchain explorers like Blockroma and Etherscan act as search engines to provide a view of the transactions and activities that are occurring on blockchains. But unlike Etherscan, Blockroma aims to be open-sourced, multi-chain and community-driven.

## Key Features

- View transaction data on EVM compatible blockchains.
- Easy to find data for particular TX hashes, addresses, or blocks.
- Developer-friendly with an open GraphQL API.

## How Can You Use Blockroma?

Blockchain and crypto users, traders, and developers frequently reference blockchain explorers to see the status of their recent transactions and measure the pulse of on-chain activity to gauge the overall trends. blockchain explorers offer a straightforward way to explore on-chain data and browse many insights and opportunities. Use Blockroma to:

- Observe activity on EVM compatible blockchains
- View the latest transactions hashes
- Keep track of the latest gas fees and transaction fees
- Develop your own dApps by determining features you like
- View information related to mining transactions
- Analyze market activity that influences blockchain growth

This information can be critical to both crypto users and blockchain developers, so we must create platforms and tools to access it in the simplest ways possible.

## What’s Next?

Blockroma will continue to be a completely free and open-source blockchain explorer, and we will continue to increase its capabilities over time. In the future, we will add developer guide, NFT/ERC721 and ERC20 support. Additionally, we will provide more advanced data pulled from multiple chains that will inform developers and investors alike.
